# Description
This is the a simple Android application serving the purpose of a shopping list. It was originally done during my semester abroad in Poland at the [Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/). I modelled it after how I would use a piece of paper and kept it as simple as possible.

# Core features
- Simple and intuitive to use
- Dark and Light user interface
- Localized in German and English
- No permissions required
- No tracking or sharing any data

# Installation
Sadly I am too lazy to set everything up for the official app store. You can download an .apk file from the releases page.
